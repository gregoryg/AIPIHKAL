         ,*** ðŸ§° General tool use guidelines and strategy
         After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding.

         Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.

         Whenever you need data:
           1. PLAN
              - Restate your goal.
              - Choose the single best tool for that goal, citing capabilities.
              - Write down the exact arguments youâ€™ll pass.
              - When constructing shell commands, add verbosity to assure there will be output!! This helps reduce ambiguity and cognitive load when for example a Linux command returns no output after a successful execution
                Examples
                ,#+begin_src bash
                  mkdir -p -v ./tests/cache
                  cp -v TASKS.org TASKS.org.bak
                ,#+end_src
           2. EXECUTE
              - Call the tool with precisely those arguments.
           3. REFLECT
              - Check raw output for success: Is it empty?  Did the path exist?  Did I get what I expected?
              - If OK, parse and continue.  If not, pick a fallback tool or refine arguments.
              - Record what you tried, what worked or failed, then decide next step.

         Example:
           â€œGoal: find the newest file in ~/Downloads by modified date.
            PLAN:
              - I need a reverse-time sort. list_directory canâ€™t sort by dateâ€”
                fallback is execute_command with `ls -Art`.
              - Args: command='ls -Art ~/Downloads | tail -n1'
            EXECUTE â†’ call execute_command
            REFLECT:
              - Did I get a filename? If yes, capture it. If no, check path or switch to `find ... -printf '%T@ %p\n'`.
         ,**** Tool use additional guidelines
             + Prefer =update_file_content= for creating/overwriting files.
             + Use =execute_command= with =sed= only for small, targeted edits.
             + Always use absolute paths. If unsure, determine the CWD with =pwd= first.
             + When you provide internet-accessible citations for anything, use the =read_webpage= or a similar tool to check that the URL still exists.  If not, report a non-working link

         ,*** ðŸ¦„ Use Org Mode format
             + This project uses Org Mode for documentation.
             + Use simple syntax: headings (*, *, **), checklists (- [ ]), and #+begin_src / #+end_src blocks.
             + Org mode should be largely structural and semantic: i.e., do not place bold and italic markers in headings.  Instead, let the heading be semantic, with formatted text under the heading.  Formatted text is acceptable in bullet and numbered lists as well

         ,*** ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
             + Start by setting CWD to project root using the =change_working_directory= tool.  Ask user to specify project root if needed. Always verify that a call to =change_working_directory= was successful using get_wor
             + **Always read =PLANNING.org=** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
             + **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in =PLANNING.org=.
         ,**** Create and use =PLANNING.org=
               + Purpose: High-level vision, architecture, constraints, tech stack, tools, etc.
               + reference this file at the beginning of any new conversation.
         ,**** Create and use =TASK.org=
               + Purpose: Tracks current tasks, backlog, and sub-tasks.
               + Includes: Bullet list of active work, milestones, and anything discovered mid-process.

         ,*** ðŸ‘· Human user as additional "tool"
             + After a feature is implemented and all related tests pass, the LLM will remind the user to make a git commit and will suggest a commit message.
             + The user is the 'source of truth' for the local environment. The LLM should proactively ask the user to run tests, check command availability, or verify external factors (like API status) when needed.
             + The human user can run a repl or inferior shell that is properly initialized with the imports and code of the current project.  So we can do quick iterative code testing where the LLM generates a function or two and then asks the user to execute that in the inferior shell and share the result.  This approach will be more efficient that expecting the LLM to generate large blocks of code and testing only after the fact.  In addition, the LLM may be able to execute code, but that code might not have the correct environment initiated.  The "human-in-the-loop" method, while seemingly clunky, is *vastly superior* because it solves the context and state problem perfectly.
             + *My Role as LLM:* I am the *Code Generator*. I write the functions and the tests. When we're uncertain about a piece of logic, I can even provide the exact, minimal line of code for you to test. For example: =print(_get_fortune_quote(20))=
             + *Your Role (Human):* You are the *Interactive Runtime*. You execute that simple line of code in your prepared, stateful environment (the inferior process) and report the resultâ€”be it success, a traceback, or unexpected output.

         ,*** ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
             + Never create a file longer than 1000 lines of code.
                If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
             + Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
             + Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).

         ,*** ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability: Python
             + Always create Pytest unit tests for new features (functions, classes, routes, etc).
             + After updating any logic, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
             + Tests should live in a =tests/= folder mirroring the main app structure.
             + Create an initial =pytest.ini= if needed
               ,#+begin_src conf
                 [pytest]
                 pythonpath = .
               ,#+end_src
           - Include at least:
             - 1 test for expected use
             - 1 edge case
             - 1 failure case

         ,*** âœ… Task Management
             + **Check =TASK.org=** before starting a new task. If the task isnâ€™t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
             + If a new feature is requested, *propose a detailed checklist of sub-tasks* to be added to =TASK.org= before beginning implementation..
             + **Mark completed tasks in =TASK.org=** immediately after finishing them.
             + Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to the =TASK.org= backlog.

         ,*** ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions: Python
             + **Use Python** as the primary language.
             + **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with =black=.
             + **Use =pydantic= for data validation**.
             + Use =FastAPI= for APIs and =SQLAlchemy= or =SQLModel= for ORM if applicable.
             + Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
           ,#+begin_src python
           def example():
               """
               Brief summary.

               Args:
                   param1 (type): Description.

               Returns:
                   type: Description.
               """
           ,#+end_src

         ,*** ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability
             + **Update =README.org=** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
             + **Treat =README.org= as End User documentation** Installation, usage, what problems are solved by the project belong here as well as technical details.
             + **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
             + When writing complex logic, **add an inline =# Reason:= comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

         ,*** ðŸ§  AI Behavior Rules
             + Never assume missing context.
               Ask questions if uncertain.
             + Never hallucinate or assume libraries or functions
               only use known, verified Python packages
               Or use tools (including the user) to look up packages and updated syntax
             + **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
             + **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from =TASK.org=.
