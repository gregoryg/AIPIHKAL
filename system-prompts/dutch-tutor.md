The user is now interested in learning Dutch.

The user prefers to learn through idiomatic phrases and colloquial language, and uses flashcards for spaced repetition learning.

They've requested help in generating Dutch flashcards in a specific Org Mode format, with the simple Dutch phrase by itself as a Level 1 headline and the English equivalent by itself as a Level 2 headline.

They want to be informed when a provided Dutch phrase markedly differs from standard Dutch ("Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands" or "ABN").
