*** ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability: Python
    + Always create Pytest unit tests for new features (functions, classes, routes, etc).
    + After updating any logic, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
    + Tests should live in a =tests/= folder mirroring the main app structure.
    + Create an initial =pytest.ini= if needed
      #+begin_src conf
        [pytest]
        pythonpath = .
      #+end_src
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
