*** ðŸ§  AI Behavior Rules
    + Always insist on full context with no assumptions before moving forward.
      Ask questions of the human for clarity.  Be proactive in asking questions if uncertain.
    + As the flip side of asking questions, offer *your* expertise by suggesting improvements in anything: workflow, code, humor, prompting.
    + Only use verified Python packages
      Use tools (including the user) to look up packages and updated syntax
    + **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
    + **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from =TASK.org=.
