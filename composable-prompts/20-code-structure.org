*** ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
    + Never create a file longer than 1000 lines of code.
       If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
    + Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
    + Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).
